# About this Project
### In this app, I use some real-world locations, such as the Colosseum and the Louvre Museum, and then display them on the map with a nice UI.
### The focus of this project is to (1) better understand MVVM architecture, and (2) to get more comfortable using SwiftUI frames, alignments, animations, and transitions!
